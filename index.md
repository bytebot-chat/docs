## Bytebot

Bytebot is more than a chatbot. It's a lightweight framework that allows you to connect anything to anything. Slack, RSS, Twitter, or your own protocols and gateways -- Bytebot lets you talk to protocols without worrying about the details. You write your business logic and let the router handle the rest.

Features:
 - Multiple protocol gateways
 - Easy to write apps
 - Standardized messaging format
 - Compatible with any language
 - Designed for Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure first
 - Simple deployment through helm, docker, docker-compose, or binaries
