## SQS Gateway

Messages from the SQS gateway follow the struct definition laid out by the [sqs.Message](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/sqs/#Message) type in the [AWS SDK for Golang v1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/)

As with other gateways, message is in the `Body` and the `Metadata` is generated by Bytebot. Because of the variable nature of the `message.Body.Body`, we cannot guarantee the contents and the consumer should be aware that there is no defined structure for this field.

```
{
  "Body": {
    "Attributes": {
      "SentTimestamp": ""
    },
    "Body": "",
    "MD5OfMessageAttributes": null,
    "MessageAttributes": null,
    "MessageId": "",
    "ReceiptHandle": ""
  },
  "Metadata": {
    "Source": "",
    "Dest": "",
    "ID": ""
  }
}
```
